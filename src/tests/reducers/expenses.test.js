//messing up the ID should make this test possible
//setting the id to -1 will mean that when we DISPATCH THE ACTION, THERE WILL BE NO CHANGES TO THE STATE
//So how do we assert that?.
//By Checking that the state that came back is exactly equal to what we passed in
//if they are equal we know that nothing change
//if the test worked with an expense with id = -1 would be creazy but there might be better ways
